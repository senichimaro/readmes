# HTTP Responses

### 100-199 - Information Response
These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.

### 200-299 - Success
This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.

### 300-399 - Redirection
These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.

### 400-499 - Client Errors
Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.

### 500-599 - Server Errors

# Common HTTP Status Codes:
There are a lot of different HTTP status codes and that's not including the fact that applications can even define their own, we'll go over the most common HTTP responses you are likely to come across:

## 200 - OK
The request was completed successfully.

## 201 - Created
A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).

## 301 - Permanent Redirect
This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.

## 302 - Temporary Redirect
Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.

## 400 - Bad Request
This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.

## 401 - Not Authorised
You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.

## 403 - Forbidden
You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.

## 405 - Method Not Allowed
The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.

## 404 - Page Not Found
The page/resource you requested does not exist.

## 500 - Internal Service Error
The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.

## 503 - Service Unavailable	
This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.
